Warp terminal themes designed by me for me.

See https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/appearance/custom-themes for more information.

## Themes

### Purple and Orange

Ubuntu-inspired theme with a deep purple background and orange accent, like the default Ubuntu terminal.

## Installation

Each theme has its own install script located in its respective directory. To install a theme, navigate to the theme's directory and run the install script:

```bash
cd <theme-name>
./install.sh
```

For example, to install the Purple and Orange theme:

```bash
cd purple_and_orange
./install.sh
```
